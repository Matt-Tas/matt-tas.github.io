How great would it be if during anytime a politician spoke on television you had their score. That score consisted of their top 5 campaign contributors and how/what they voted on recently. 

This is an idea I heard about from Dan Carlin on his podcast [common sense](http://www.dancarlin.com/common-sense-home-landing-page/).
