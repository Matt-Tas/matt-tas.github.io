Apple allows you to enter your business into its maps application, which is the default mapping application on most IOS devices.

If you haven't put you're website up on here, you could be missing out. It should be easy (although often these things turn out to be more difficult than they should), and you should do it right away at [Apple Maps Connect](https://mapsconnect.apple.com/).

Of course this assumes you have already added your business to google maps, the definitive juggernaut of online visibility, visit [Google My Business](https://www.google.com.au/business/).
