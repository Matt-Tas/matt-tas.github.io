As my very first conference on digital analytics I hoped to find a mature field where I could test my skill set and get some creative ideas for the future. 

Mission accomplished. 

Loves data has done a phenomenal job of delivering value even considering the pricey ticket cost. Industry superstars, several Google reps and top tier visual communication experts deliver a well rounded education that offers instantly valuable takeaways as well as long term scalable strategies for a range of businesses. 

##Primary Takeaway

I've heard recently that if you can fully action just one take-away from a presentation you'll have done well. For me the primary one was this: **You can have all the data driven insights in the world, but if you cannot convince audience than none of that hard work matters.**

###You need a problems vs. solutions context and a good dash of stagecraft!

Breifly they are:

1. Become indispensable - do your job so well you'll be the best to important to lose
2. Don't suck at testing - know the data, the tools and become like a forensic expert
3. Eliminate death by powerpoint - death of your career unless you present well
4. Resist plug and play analytics - the raw data is almost useless without context
5. Power up to get further in your career - learn, play, teach - thrive

Ben Mangold from LovesData really nailed it when he said that play was a huge component of how we learn. If you aren't playing, at some point, you aren't serious about digital analytics. He also encouraged the audience to get involved in a mentor/mentee relationship to push really kickstart your understanding.

##Plan of action

To get the most out of this deluge of information I plan on getting all of the presentations and reviewing them to solidify the takeaways. I'm also going to:
1. Finish Google's online analytics training
2. Finish Codeacademys javascript tutorial
3. Dive into Google Tag manager

Some other ways I can improve my skillset is to:
- Apply more focus to my online strategies
- Improve measurement and reporting of proper metrics
- Use A/B testing to help push through stagnant sites

Longer term goals are:
- Improve connection with the Digital Analytics Industry
- Look at the feasability of personalisation for some clients
- Sign up for next years conference

That is the basic de-brief for now. I'll most likely re-visit this to tidy it up down the track.
