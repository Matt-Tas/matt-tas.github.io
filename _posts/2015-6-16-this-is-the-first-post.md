title: Search Engine Optimization - The first post
---

I partially created this blog as an exercise in building an elemental site with some strong core beliefs. One of them is the **importance of content**.

As google primarily ranks sites based on authority, it follows that this small site out in the infinite space of the internet won't grow at a large clip with only my thoughts to power it. I do intend however to see if there is any organic traffic that finds its way here.

I plan on writing exactly what I think new small business websites should do to get visible. 

Nothing!
